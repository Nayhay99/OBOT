# Contextual Chatbot
This is a chatbot using python libraries like NLTK and Tensorflow.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python3 must be installed. And pip must be available on the command line

### Installing

Few packages are necessary to be installed in order to access these libraries

```
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install nltk
pip install tflearn
pip install pickle
```
Use pip3 for python3.

From NLTK we need to download certain packages like corpus, punkt, stop_words

```
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('corpora')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
